# Calculator project

From [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator).

## Functionalities
* add
* subtract
* multiply
* divide
* multiple operators
* floating points
* backspace/delete last entry only

## UI
Apple-ish

## To improve
* less alerts, just ignore multiple entries of operators or decimal points.

## Lessons learned
* Need to think more like a JS programmer. Use more events instead of array manipulation.
* Use classes instead of a lot of scattered functions and global variables
